## How to set up

Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed correctly.

1. Open your browser and navigate to the restaurant you are trying to track reservations for (e.g. `https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dine-res/restaurant/le-cellier-steakhouse`)
2. Press Ctrl + Shift + I
3. Press Ctrl + F and type "&U7=" (without quotes)
4. Copy the ID (the number) after "U7=" equals and before the "&".
5. Put that number as an entry in `config.json`. You can see an example `config.json` in the root of this repository.
